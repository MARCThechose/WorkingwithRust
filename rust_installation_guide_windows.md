## Prerequisites

Before installing Rust, you may need to install the Visual Studio prerequisites for the MSVC toolchain. Visit the following link for detailed instructions: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html

## Installation Steps

1. Download the Rust installer (`rustup-init.exe`) from: https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64

2. Run the downloaded `rustup-init.exe` file.

3. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation. The installer will guide you through the process, including selecting the default toolchain and components.

## Verification

After installation, open a new command prompt or PowerShell window and run the following commands to verify that Rust is installed correctly:

- `rustc --version` (should display the Rust compiler version)
- `cargo --version` (should display the Cargo package manager version)
